# Pytorch-Classifier-for-CIFAR10

This is an exercise done for one of the courses of my MSc in Deep Learning.

This script implements all the necessary steps for classifying images with PyTorch: imports, data loading, model creation, training and results display.

This code has been run in Google Colab using a GPU.
